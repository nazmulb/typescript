# TypeScript

TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java, which is developed and maintained by Microsoft. It was introduced by Anders Hejlsberg, a core member of the development team of C# language. TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript.

TypeScript is not directly run on the browser. It needs a compiler to compile and generate in JavaScript file. TypeScript is the ES6 version of JavaScript with some additional features.

## Why use TypeScript?

We use TypeScript because of the following benefits:

- TypeScript supports Static typing, Strongly type, Modules, Optional Parameters, etc.
- TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, etc.
- TypeScript is fast, simple, and most importantly, easy to learn.
- TypeScript provides the error-checking feature at compilation time. It will compile the code, and if any error found, then it highlighted the mistakes before the script is run.
- TypeScript supports all JavaScript libraries because it is the superset of JavaScript.
- TypeScript make app development quick and easy as possible, and the tooling support of TypeScript gives us autocompletion, type checking, and source documentation.
- TypeScript has a definition file with .d.ts extension to provide a definition for external JavaScript libraries like jQuery.
- TypeScript gives all the benefits of ES6 plus more productivity.
