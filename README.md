# TypeScript

TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java, which is developed and maintained by Microsoft. It was introduced by Anders Hejlsberg, a core member of the development team of C# language. TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript.

TypeScript is not directly run on the browser. It needs a compiler to compile and generate in JavaScript file. TypeScript is the ES6 version of JavaScript with some additional features.
